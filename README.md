# Partial Bridge Monitoring Data and Data Access Instructions
## 1. Partial Data Display
Here is a portion of the bridge monitoring data used in our research. This data includes information such as the day of the week, hour of the day, and various sensor readings related to the bridge's status, including dynamic deflection (DCAM01 - DCAM04), static deflection (SCAM01 - SCAM06), inclination (INC01 - X, INC01 - Y, INC02 - X, INC02 - Y), displacement (DIS01, DIS02), temperature (TEM), humidity (HUM), and the logarithmically transformed dynamic strain data (log_drsg).
